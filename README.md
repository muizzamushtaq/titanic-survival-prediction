# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction (Machine Learning)

This machine learning project predicts passenger survival on the Titanic dataset using Python and Scikit-learn.

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn & Matplotlib (Visualization)
- Scikit-learn (ML)
- Jupyter / VS Code

## 🔍 Steps Performed
1. Loaded Titanic dataset using Seaborn
2. Cleaned missing data
3. Converted categorical to numerical (e.g., male/female, embarked)
4. Split data into training and testing
5. Trained a Decision Tree Classifier
6. Evaluated model accuracy and confusion matrix
7. Visualized survival distribution

## 📈 Accuracy Achieved
- Accuracy: ~X% (automatically calculated)
- Model: Decision Tree Classifier

## 📊 Visuals Included
- Survival count bar graph
- Confusion matrix

## 📁 Files Included
- `titanic_model.py` (or `.ipynb`)
- `README.md`
